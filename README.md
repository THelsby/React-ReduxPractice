A small project which showcases some techniques available in React and Redux. During this project I have taken advantage of;

React:
  • One way data flow<br/>
  • JSX<br/>
  • State and Props<br/>
  • Fetch<br/>
  • Virtual DOM for optimal view changes<br/>
  • Lifecycle hooks<br/>
  • Error bounderies<br/>
  • Components and Containers<br/>
Redux:
  • Redux Store and Provider<br/>
  • Actions and Reducers<br/>
  • Connect<br/>
  • Async Actions<br/>
  
  To use this website you can clone the repo and use npm start to view.
