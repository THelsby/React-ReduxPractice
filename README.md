A small project which showcases some techniques available in React and Redux. During this project I have taken advantage of;

React
  • One way data flow.
  • JSX
  • State and Props
  • Fetch
  • Virtual DOM for optimal view changes
  • Lifecycle hooks
  • Error bounderies
  • Components and Containers
Redux
  • Redux Store and Provider
  • Actions and Reducers
  • Connect
  • Async Actions
  
  To use this website you can clone the repo and use npm start to view.
